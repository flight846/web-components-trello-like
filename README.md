# trello-board-clone
A Trello-like board using JavaScript web components

## Usage

To run a sample of how this works:
* In the terminal, CD to project directory and run 'npm install --save json-server' 
* Once installed, 'type npm start'. This will run the [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) needed to make fake api calls and will serve static html page

## Dependencies

Your web browser should be able to support Web Components, JS Promises and Fetch API.
